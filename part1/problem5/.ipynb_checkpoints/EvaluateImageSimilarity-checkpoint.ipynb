Randomly replace 10 pixels of the image with 255 values and compare the modified image with the original image using the MSE and PSNR methods. Shift all the pixels of the original image one pixel upwards and compare with the original image through the methods mentioned.\n",

Read the images that are exclusively related to the numbers 3 and 7 in the train path. Calculate an average of all images related to the number 3. Also repeat this action for the number 7. In the valid path, read images of the numbers 3 and 7 in about 10 images, and for each MSE and PSNR image, compare it with the two averages 3 and 7. Can this method be used to recognize images of handwritten numbers? Report the challenges of this method. The report should be presented using the image and statistics related to the mentioned steps.**"
